## Jack-VM
A web based VM for the Jack language from nand2tetris

### To run 
Compile jack-vm directory with "cargo build"
In jack-vm/jack-web do "npm run start" -> should start website on localhost

### To use


### To-do by monday:
- add text entry for bytecode
- maybe make it slightly presentable :P


Future Goals:
- Set up Svelte front end for the VM
- Rewrite Jack compiler in Rust so it can be added as a wasm binding or a webworker
- Add codemirror components 
- Add options for range of memory visualization
